Practical Linux command line documentation

## Video scripts
Sometimes colleages and my friends wants technical information from me. I prefer recoding videos to make information resudial. 
I was thinking about how to make documentation more reliable. I can write to somewhere. I don't have website design skills for now.
I am writing video scripts temporarily.
